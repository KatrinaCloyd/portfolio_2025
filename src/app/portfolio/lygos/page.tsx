          <p>Lygos specializes in innovative, sustainable solutions, working to replace petrochemicals
            with cleaner, high-performing plant-based alternatives. During my time working with The Program,
            Lygos came to us in need of a new brand identity and website that would reflect its core values
            and support their growth.

            <p>At project kickoff, I was working as a part of the technical development team of five.
              Working hand in hand with the design team remotely collaborating, we completed this full
              site build in under three months. Just in time for Lygos&apos; new product launch.

            <h2>An easily editable website for a growing company</h2>
            <p>Because of the nature of the company, Lygos and their product offerings are always growing and
              changing. Meaning their website needed to be just as flexible to allow for that growth and change.
              To support this need we implemented a new visual CMS, Builder.io.
            </p>
            <p>Builder.io allows for custom components, to keep the design, look and feel of the website
              consistent and in line with the new brand guidelines, while also allowing editors to add new
              content, reorder page flows, edit links, and upload new assets without developer involvement.
            </p>
            <p>With a tech stack including Next.js, custom React components, Typescript, Styled Components,
              and Vercel for hosting, we delivered this and more.

          <h2>Give it structure</h2>
          <p>The first step of this site build was digesting the finalized Figma prototypes. From there we determined
            which information was being reused throughout the site widely enough to constitute reusable data entries
            vs which content should be one-off entries. We then broke the designs down into self contained
            components, solidified the content model, wrote the tickets, and dove into agile development.

            <h2>Flexible site with guardrails</h2>
            <p>While Builder.io allows for full editor control in the interface, we decided that there needed to be limitations.
              We now had a beautiful new brand and while we wanted to allow editor freedom, we didn&apos;t want anyone to be able to
              break from the design system. Instead we opted for a library of completely controlled and styled custom components.
              From smaller building blocks like inline Links, Buttons, and Informational Cards, to larger page sections like
              Carousels and Contact Forms. All of which were developed with baked-in responsive, mobile-first design, accessibility
              considerations and best practices, and usage guardrails.
            </p>
            <p>For example, editors can select if the section should have a grey background or a navy, but the color of the text
              in that section is dynamically hard coded based on the selected background color for contrast needs and design
              consistency.

        <div className={styles.textOnly}>
          <h2>Cross team collaboration</h2>
          <p>As we neared the final launch of the refreshed site, the development team worked hand-in-hand for final
            functional and design QA. Continuing to work in an agile approach, new tickets were created as the design
            team requested adjustments or received final approval on assets and copy.

            <p>Utilizing Next.js dynamic routes and static site generation functions this site was initially launched
              with 14 main landing pages and 9 blog page entries. However, the site could support the creation and
              publication of as many additional pages and blog entries as the marketing team decides to publish. All
              without any additional development work.
            </p>
            <p>Final launch also included multiple integrations, such as enabling Hubspot form embeds and tracking,
              and Google analytics â€“ for conversion and event tracking.

            design and develop new components to support their changing needs and growing product offerings.

            so rewarding to be helping a truly sustainable company grow and expand their reach.
