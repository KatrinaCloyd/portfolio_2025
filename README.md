# Katring Cloyd Portfolio Site - 2025

Hi! Welcome to the code side of my portfolio site! 
As the site says, I am a Frontend Software engineer with a soft spot for great design. With a background in the arts and graphic design, I have an eye for details and a drive to get them just right.

Please, explore the rest of my GitHub to see other projects, experiments, and client sites.
